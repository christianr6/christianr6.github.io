* Lab 8
    Lab 8, part 3 was one of my favorite because we got to manipulate the microseconds on the animation. By pausing the animation for 2,000 microseconds it would make the animation run nice and smooth. Also I enjoyed learning about the member function get() because it reads the input file stream and then prints into the termial making it display the animation.
* Lab 10
    Lab 10, part 2 was one of my favorite because we created a two demisonal data structure that measure californias population by county. This is where we got to use 2D vectors to put data into a table. I learned that .cc filed can be used along side .h files to create cleaner more efficent code.
* Lab 11
    Lab 11, part 2 was one of my favorites because it taught me to link in all .h and .cc files. It taught how to create a more efficent and cleaner approach to creating code. I found this usefull for the future programs that a large enough that they need multiple files.
