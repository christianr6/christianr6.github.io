## CPSC 120

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 3 was one of my favorite because we got to manipulate the microseconds on the animation. Pausing the animation for 2,000 microseconds it made the animation run nicely and smoothly. Also, I enjoyed learning about the member function get() because it reads the input file stream and then prints into the termial making it display the animation.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 was one of my favorite because we created a two dimensional data structure that measures California population by county. This is where we got to use 2D vectors to put data into a table. I learned that a .cc filed can be used along side .h files to create cleaner more efficient code.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 2 was one of my favorites because it taught me how to link .h and .cc files. Also, it taught how to create a more efficient and cleaner approach to creating code. I found this usefull for the future programs that have a large enough that they need multiple files.
